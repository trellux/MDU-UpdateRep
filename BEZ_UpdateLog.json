    {
      "version": "2.0",
      "date": "February 28, 2026",
      "sections": {
        "New": [
          "Clothoid transitions (Euler spirals) at the entry and exit of every curve — curvature now ramps in and out smoothly instead of jumping straight to full arc radius",
          "Hairpin merging: overlapping rounded corners now resolve into a single clean hairpin shape instead of breaking",
          "Custom curvature mode rebuilt with speed-driven geometry — arcs widen at higher design speeds and tighten at lower ones",
          "B-Spline elevation interpolation for smoother grade transitions along the vertical alignment",
          "Axis-lock point editing — lock movement to a single axis when adjusting a placed point",
          "Hold right-click to place road points as an alternative to left-click",
          "Distance readout in the plotting dock showing total road length while placing points",
          "Expandable warning messages with a pin highlight showing exactly which point is causing a tight-curve issue",
          "All docks unified under a dark charcoal theme with animated status banners and warning rows",
          "Help dock completely redesigned — tabbed layout with pages for Workflow, Terminology, Warnings, Road Styles, and Credits",
          "Changelog tab in Help showing live version status from GitHub, with a configurable refresh cooldown"
        ],
        "Improved": [
          "Superelevation transitions are smoother and more consistent — overlapping zones now blend instead of producing a crease, and reversals on S-curves begin earlier",
          "Banking amplitude increased so road lean is more visible at typical design speeds",
          "Speed input range extended to 5–80",
          "Unsaved changes indicator in Road Styles so it's always clear when your settings haven't been applied yet"
        ],
        "Fixed": [
          "Crash when clicking an existing road in the world to start a new one",
          "Selection highlights lingering on roads after entering or exiting an edit mode",
          "Road Styles section blockers pushing content down instead of overlaying it"
        ]
